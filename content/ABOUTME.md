This is an about me, who I am, etcetera

###My name is Ai Kagami
My first name really is Ai (pronounced like the letter i)

My last name is a pen name, alias, or pseudonym depending on what you wish to call it. My last name is no great secret and by either asking around or asking me you can find out my last name, but I will not put it here.

I go by the username "Boop" or "BoopEnthusiast" if I am unable to use Boop

##Contact me:
Discord: Boop#7244
email: onpotis@gmail.com

I am not on many social media applications for a multitude of reasons, which I may rant about in a post but I will not put here. I have nothing against people that use social media don't get mad.
