This is an about me, who I am, etcetera

###My name is Ai Kagami
My first name really is Ai (pronounced like the letter i)

My last name is a pen name, alias, or pseudonym depending on what you wish to call it. My last name is no great secret and by either asking around or asking me you can find out my last name, but I will not put it here.

I go by the username "Boop" or "BoopEnthusiast" if I am unable to use Boop
