This file is full of other files which are full of files within files within files within etcetera. 
There are specific codes you can do to find a specific file.
Good luck finding them out! I might give you personally a code, or some will be scattered around my site, hidden with cryptography or the like. Or some might be blaringly obvious, like the konami code.
Excess readmes are filled with a few copypastas.

### Currently there is **one** hidden file to find.
