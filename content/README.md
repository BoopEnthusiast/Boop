Hello, welcome to my site

My name is Ai Kagami

This is my website


The purpose of this README is to help you navigate the site. It should be mostly self-explanatory but just in case I will write anything I deem not self-explanatory here.

## VERY basics:
#### Up the top there is the directory you are in
Click on "Boop" at any point to return to the main page  
In the directory if you have entered a folder before entering a post, you can click on the name of the folder to return to it at the top
#### The date of any post can be seen below the title of the post
This post's date is on my birthday and not the date of the post. It is also at year zero
#### To the right of the date you can see the tags of any post
This post's sole tag is #No tags, which is a tag  
You can click on tags to see all posts with that tag  
When looking at all posts with a tag you can look in the directory and go back to look at all of the tags ever used
